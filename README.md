Automatic speaker recognition experiments with deep neural nets
This repository contains code to replicate speaker recognition experiments on TIMIT database using DNN 

(1) A baseline GMM-UBM implemtation of microsoft toolbox (MST Identity) is also added.

(2) For DNNs, several initialization schemes like (normalized initialization, random walk init.. etc ,) and learning rate methods like 
(sgd-cm,ada-delta and adam) are implemented in matlab.

It is a GPU based code. :)
